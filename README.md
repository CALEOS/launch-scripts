# launch-scripts

- For the ParseSnapshot.js file, you'll need a recent version of nodejs (latest ubuntu doesn't come with the latest nodejs by default)
- And then in the same directory as you'll run the script from, you'll want a file named snapshot.csv, without a header line
- In that same directory you'll also want to run `npm install readline eosjs@beta node-fetch text-encoding promise-parallel-throttle single-line-log argparse`
